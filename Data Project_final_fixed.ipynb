      "Stephen F. Miller Place, NY King James by Ryan Jones is a biography of Lebron's James' life prior to going into the NBA. It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.\n",

This book takes research that perhaps never found a place in other papers or books about Lincoln and uses it to show us a different way to see him and the events leading to the Civil War.This book contains numerous interesting bits of information about Lincoln although the one piece I found most interesting was the fact that Lincoln was a land surveyor for a time. Many writers focus on Lincoln's limited education but a surveyor must have a good understanding of mathematics and by most accounts, Lincoln was very competent. This brings to issue the long standing belief that Lincoln had little formal education but,according to the author, Lincoln's formal education was consistant with that received by young people at that time.There are some sections of this book where Lincoln's name fails to appear and the reader might have cause to wonder if he is reading the wrong book. Fortunately, these little detours are not only interesting but help us see Lincoln and the Civil War period from a new perspective.I found this short book (about 200 pages) to be interesting and engaging.

      "An excelent translation A graceful and clear translation of the Holy Bible, the NRSV maintains fidelity to the original Greek and Hebrew texts while producing an edition equally at home when read from the lectern at church or on the couch at home. The translators have carefully reviewed words which refer to men only, and, when appropriate, translated them to include all the faithful. For example, when the Apostle Paul addresses the &quot;brothers&quot;, the NRSV substitutes &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;brothers and sisters.&quot; They never tamper with masculine references to God. It is their contention that this slight modification actually makes their translation more accurate. For example, when St. Paul says, &quot;Brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant concerning the resurrection,&quot; this version reminds us that the sisters should also not be ignorant. The complete version with the Apocryphal / Deuterocanonical books contains the fullest collection of books received as sacred Scripture by any historical branch of the Christian Church.

      "Not your ordinary Lincoln biography According to the author's Preface, the publisher originally wanted to title this work \"Chips from a Historian's Workbench.\" While awkward, that title was certainly perceptive. This book takes research that perhaps never found a place in other papers or books about Lincoln and uses it to show us a different way to see him and the events leading to the Civil War.This book contains numerous interesting bits of information about Lincoln although the one piece I found most interesting was the fact that Lincoln was a land surveyor for a time. Many writers focus on Lincoln's limited education but a surveyor must have a good understanding of mathematics and by most accounts, Lincoln was very competent. This brings to issue the long standing belief that Lincoln had little formal education but,according to the author, Lincoln's formal education was consistant with that received by young people at that time.There are some sections of this book where Lincoln's name fails to appear and the reader might have cause to wonder if he is reading the wrong book. Fortunately, these little detours are not only interesting but help us see Lincoln and the Civil War period from a new perspective.I found this short book (about 200 pages) to be interesting and engaging. It was written by an author who understands how to communicate and keep the reader's interest. I would recommend it to anyone having an interest in Lincoln or the Civil War.\n",

      "An excelent translation A graceful and clear translation of the Holy Bible, the NRSV maintains fidelity to the original Greek and Hebrew texts while producing an edition equally at home when read from the lectern at church or on the couch at home. The translators have carefully reviewed words which refer to men only, and, when appropriate, translated them to include all the faithful. For example, when the Apostle Paul addresses the &quot;brothers&quot;, the NRSV substitutes &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;brothers and sisters.&quot; They never tamper with masculine references to God. It is their contention that this slight modification actually makes their translation more accurate. For example, when St. Paul says, &quot;Brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant concerning the resurrection,&quot; this version reminds us that the sisters should also not be ignorant. The complete version with the Apocryphal / Deuterocanonical books contains the fullest collection of books received as sacred Scripture by any historical branch of the Christian Church. By including such difficult-to-find books as 3 Maccabees and Psalm 151, they have produced the only easily obtainable Bible for the whole Church.\n",
